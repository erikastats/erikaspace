<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>When I was doing the subject Computational Statistics 2 in the <span class="math inline">\(4^{th}\)</span> year of my graduation, I wasn’t expecting that Statistical Simulation would be so important in the analytical world. Suddenly, I could see that almost all the advanced analysis used it to complement and reinforce the results.</p>
<p>That said, this post will contain some teory and aplication of Monte Carlo Simulation. Let’s enjoy it!</p>
