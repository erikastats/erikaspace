# Introduction

When I was doing the subject Computational Statistics 2 in the $4^{th}$ year of my graduation, I wasn't expecting that Statistical Simulation would be so important in the analytical world. Suddenly, I could see that almost all the advanced analysis used it to complement and reinforce the results.   

That said, this post will contain some teory and aplication of Monte Carlo Simulation. Let's enjoy it!
